- The Functions implemented *should* also return:
  - `status_code` - a status code from The API.
  - `api_delay` - Delay in seconds to wait before retrying the request to The API (if no rate limit, set to 0)
  - `message` - Information about the call the The Function.
  - Note: Every The Function should handle rate limiting.
