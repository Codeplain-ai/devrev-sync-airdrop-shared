Test the rate limiting of The Function "{{ function_name }}" with the following flow:
  - Make a POST request to "http://localhost:8004/start_rate_limiting" with body `{ "test_name": <identifyer of the test>}`.
  - Invoke The Function "{{ function_name }}" with valid credentials and all required parameters.
  - Expect: `status_code = 429`.
  - Expect: `api_delay > 0` and `api_delay <= 3`. If api_delay is bigger than 3, assume the problem is that we did not calculate the api_delay correctly in The Implementation Code.
  - Make a POST request to "http://localhost:8004/end_rate_limiting".
