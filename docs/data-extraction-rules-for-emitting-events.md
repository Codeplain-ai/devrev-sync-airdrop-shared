# Data Extraction Rules for Emitting Events

## Input event: `EXTRACTION_DATA_START` or `EXTRACTION_DATA_CONTINUE`

Here are the rules when `EXTRACTION_DATA_START` or `EXTRACTION_DATA_CONTINUE` event is received by the snap-in:

- If there's a timeout ("onTimeout" method in "spawn" method), the snap-in should emit an event with type `EXTRACTION_DATA_PROGRESS` (no "data" payload).
  - Note: Event `EXTRACTION_DATA_PROGRESS` **MUST NEVER** be emitted if the "task" method in The Worker Thread. The Only place where `EXTRACTION_DATA_PROGRESS` can be emitted is in the "onTimeout" method in The Worker Thread.
- If the extraction is successful and all the resources have been extracted, the snap-in should emit an event with type `EXTRACTION_DATA_DONE` (no "data" payload).
- In case of unexpected error, the snap-in should emit an event with type `EXTRACTION_DATA_ERROR` ("data" payload should contain attribute "error" - error message as a string).
- In case of rate limiting (status code 429) for "data extraction", the snap-in *must* emit an event with type `EXTRACTION_DATA_DELAY`. If emitting event of type `EXTRACTION_DATA_DELAY`, you *must* also provide a "delay" attribute, specifying the delay in seconds as an integer.
  - Example: `await adapter.emit(ExtractorEventType.ExtractionDataDelay, { delay: "30" });`

## Input event: `EXTRACTION_EXTERNAL_SYNC_UNITS_START`

Here are the rules when `EXTRACTION_EXTERNAL_SYNC_UNITS_START` event is received by the snap-in:

- If "external sync unit extraction" is successful and the snap-in has extracted all the external sync units, the snap-in should emit an event with type `EXTRACTION_EXTERNAL_SYNC_UNITS_DONE` (no "data" payload).
- In case of unexpected error, the snap-in should emit an event with type `EXTRACTION_EXTERNAL_SYNC_UNITS_ERROR` ("data" payload should contain attribute "error" - error message as a string).
- In case of rate limiting (status code 429) for "external sync unit extraction", the snap-in should also emit an event with type `EXTRACTION_EXTERNAL_SYNC_UNITS_ERROR`.

## Input event: `EXTRACTION_METADATA_START`

Here are the rules when `EXTRACTION_METADATA_START` event is received by the snap-in:
- If "metadata extraction" is successful and the snap-in has extracted all the metadata, the snap-in should emit an event with type `EXTRACTION_METADATA_DONE` (no "data" payload).
- In case of unexpected error, the snap-in should emit an event with type `EXTRACTION_METADATA_ERROR` ("data" payload should contain attribute "error" - error message as a string).

## Input event: `EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_START` or `EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_CONTINUE`

Here are the rules when `EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_START` or `EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_CONTINUE` event is received by the snap-in:
- If "attachments extraction" is successful and the snap-in has extracted all the attachments, the snap-in should emit an event with type "EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_DONE"
- If case of unexpected error, the snap-in should emit an event with type "EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_ERROR" ("data" payload should contain attribute "error" - error message as a string).
- In case of rate limiting (status code 429) for "attachments extraction", the snap-in should also emit an event with type "EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_DELAY". If emitting event of type "EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_DELAY", you *must* also provide a "delay" attribute, specifying the delay in seconds as an integer.
  - Example: `await adapter.emit(ExtractorEventType.ExtractionAttachmentsDelay, { delay: "30" });`
- If there's a timeout ("onTimeout" method in "spawn" method), the snap-in should emit an event with type "EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_PROGRESS".


## IMPORTANT FOR ALL INPUT EVENTS

- In all cases, only a single event should be emitted.
